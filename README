BtSerial Library for Processing for Android

This library gives you access to a Bluetooth Serial port on Android devices that have Bluetooth.
It's structured using Processing's Serial library API, so those familiar with Serial should be able to do
the same things with this as they can with Serial.

There are some differences:
* You have to enable Bluetooth on your device.
* You have to pair with the device you want to talk to in advance. 
* in P4A, every time your device changes orientation, your sketch will restart. 
	So you have to disconnect() on pause() and connect on resume().

This library was based on SweetBlue, a Bluetooth library for Processing and Arduino,
by Andreas Gšransson & David Cuartielles at 1scale1.se. For connections between 
Processing for Android and Arduino without having to write your own Arduino
firmware, see https://github.com/1scale1/sweetbt. It was also based in Ben Fry's Serial
library for Processing(http://code.google.com/p/processing/), 
and on Google's BluetoothChatService example for Android 
(http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/BluetoothChat).
Thanks to Bonifaz Kaufman, developer of Amarino (http://code.google.com/p/amarino) for 
many good ideas as well.
